          The chicken nugget is a chicken product consisting of a small piece of
          chicken meat that is breaded or battered, then deep-fried or baked.
          Invented in the 1950s, chicken nuggets have become a popular fast food
          restaurant item, as well as widely sold frozen for home use.

        Chicken nuggets are generally regarded as a fatty, unhealthy food.<a href="www.google.com">[4]</a>
        <span><a href="www.google.com">[5]</a></span> A study published in the American Journal of Medicine analyzed the
        composition of chicken nuggets from two American fast food chains. It
        found that less than half of the material was skeletal muscle, with fat
        occurring in an equal or greater proportion. Other components included
        epithelial tissue, bone, nervous tissue and connective tissue. The
        authors concluded that "Chicken nuggets are mostly fat, and their name
        is a misnomer."<a href="www.google.com">[6]</a>
      </p>

      <h2>History of nuggets</h2>
      <p>
        The chicken nugget was invented in the 1950s by Robert C. Baker, a food
        science professor at Cornell University, and published as unpatented
        academic <a href="www.google.com">[2]</a> This bite-sized piece of chicken, coated in batter and
        then deep fried, was called the "Chicken Crispie" by Baker and his
        associates. Two problems the meat industry was facing at the time were
        being able to clump ground meat without a skin and producing a batter
        coating that could be both deep fried and frozen without becoming
        detached. Baker's innovations solved these problems and made it possible
        to form chicken nuggets in any shape by first coating the meat in
        vinegar, salt, grains, and milk powder to make it hold together and then
        using an egg and grain based batter that could be fried as well as
        frozen. <a href="www.google.com">[3]</a> 
        <p>
        The processing required for making chicken nuggets begins
        with deboning. The chicken is cut and shaped to the correct size. This
        is done either manually, or by a series of automatic blades, or by a
        process called grinding (a method of deboning in which the softer parts
        of the chicken carcass are forced through a mesh, leaving behind the
        more solid pieces, resulting in a meat paste. If used, this paste is
        then shaped before battering). The pieces are battered and breaded in a
        large cylindrical drum that rotates, evenly coating all of the pieces in
        the desired spices and breading. The pieces are then fried in oil until
        the batter has set and the outside reaches the desired color. Finally,
        the nuggets are packaged, frozen and stored for shipping. <a href="www.google.com">[7]</a>
        <a href="gwww.google.com">[8]</a> While specific ingredients and production 
        methods may vary between manufacturers, the above practices hold true 
        for most of the industry.

      <h2>Recipe</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1– inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 cup dill pickle juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 quart canola oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken chunks into a large zip-top bag. Pour the pickle 
              juice, milk, and hot sauce into the bag and seal. Massage the mixture 
              together and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, bread crumbs, garlic powder, 
                  salt, pepper, paprika, and powdered sugar.</li>
        <li>Drain the chicken from the pickle juice mixture. Working in 
                      batches coat the chicken chunks in the breading, making sure all 
                      sides are coated.</li>
        <li>Turn your oven onto warm and set aside a large baking sheet.</li>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven heat the oil over medium heat. Oil should reach 350°F, 
            or when you place the back of a wooden spoon into the oil bubbles should form 
            around it immediately.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, place chicken into the hot oil. Allow the chicken to fry for 
            4-5 minutes, until it is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken nuggets from the oil and place onto 
            the baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the oven to keep the nuggets warm 
            while you fry the remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Serve warm</li>
